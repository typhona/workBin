Work computer scripts

I use these on a regular basis for my work. The call, parts, rma, and gameReport
scripts are all based around a DIY call log so I can keep track of who I called
and about what. I need to do A LOT more work on making them more user friendly.

The others are just scripts I have installed on all my machines, just easier
updating and one for my wifi dongle. The wifi isnt super appreciated by linux
mint so I lose wifi Whenever the kernel is updated. I got tired of having to
look up the installation steps on my phone everytime so I made a script and
added an alias and now all I have to do is type wifi into my command line and it
reinstalls my wifi for me.
